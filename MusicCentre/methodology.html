<h1>Different Methods for Different People</h1>    
    
<p>All music can be categorized under three broad categories: Classical, Folk and Popular.</p>
<p>I would suggest that there are three ways of learning music and that each method lends itself particularly well to a specific genre:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The use of  sight-reading is most often used in a classical context</li>
    <li>The use of aural exposure and repetition is a method utilized most often in traditional and folk genres</li>
    <li>The use of chord based harmonies with a multitude of instruments is often associated with the popular music genre</li>
</ol>
    
<p>While these methods tend to lend themselves more favourably towards some genres of music and not so well towards others I maintain the firm believe that a well-rounded musician should have experience in all the aforementioned methods of learning his or her instrument. The problems with institutionalized forms of education is the necessity to get a group of individuals through a series of exams under a set amount of time. There is little time for the teacher to be able to explore specific students specialised areas of expertise in either listening, performing or oral performances.</p>

<h1>The Classical Approach</h1>

<p>The Classical music genre generally refers to the Western Canon i.e. a representational collection of works that would usually sit comfortable in a concert hall. Works by Bach, Mozart, Handel, Haydn and Beethoven are but a few examples of the kinds of artists we may find within this genre.</p>
    
<p>The main method that most teachers employ towards teaching their students these works is through the teaching of sight reading. First a teacher would familiarize their students with the concept of rhythm and pitch. Rhythm is usually introduced with the aid of a metronome that would accompany the student during performance. Once familiar with the rhythmic aspects of a work the idea of pitch is introduce to the student primarily through the use of a Stave. The Stave refers to the five lines drawn horizontally on a score. Usually acronyms are utilized to make the notes easier to remember. The lines as seen in the diagram below represent the notes EGBDF, one popular method used to familiarize students with this is the phrase ‘Every Good Boy Deserves Fruit’. When learning the note values between the lines the word FACE is used to further aid the students memory of the note names.</p>
    
<p>A series of grade examinations are available to students undergoing such a rigorous method of learning an instrument. These tests examine their practical ability, as well as their aural and theoretical understanding of the music they are performing.</p>

<h1>The Folk/Traditional Approach</h1>

<p>Due to the nature of the oral transmissions of traditional music in Ireland most tunes would be learned off by listening and repeating. Rhythmic patterns i.e. Jigs, Reels, Airs, Hornpipes help the traditional musicians keep a steady rhythmic framework for the works they are performing, but across different locations alterations in the melodies are common especially through the use of ornamentation. When the tunes are written down it is usually in an alphabetic style rather than the more concise classical style using stave notation. It is not uncommon now however to find a copy of Sharon Shannon or the Dubliners in a manuscript stave form.</p>
    
<p>Outside of the Irish tradition other cultures such as those in Africa and South Asia have no legacy of stave music in their history and as such they have no reliance on such detailed forms of musical records. As a result their lessons are often given in groups using repeated rhythmic patterns usually outlined by a form of percussive drum. Again this form of musical transmission is all oral/aural. In some contexts the music in these cultures fulfills a ceremonial or religious ritual purpose and as such the musicians are regarded with different levels of respect. This is highly contrasting towards the Irish tradition which is primarily utilised for entertainment purposes, or in some cases for cultural preservation i.e. in Gaeltacht regions.</p>

    <div class=banner></div>
    
<h1>The Popular Approach</h1>
    
<p>Popular music has always varied from year to year and decade to decade. When considering the methods utilized by musicians today to learn new popular music TABS and basic Chordal knowledge are frequently used. With the development of the Internet into most homes across Ireland nearly everybody can obtain access to guitar TABS. Unlike the stave music TABS feature only 6 lines representing the strings of the guitar (or 4 in the case of bass tabs) and numbers representing which fret and strings to cover. The image below shows the extreme contrast between the tab and stave forms of notation. There are other versions of TABS that outline strumming rhythms with the use of western notation (rhythmically anyway). It's quite often that you will find most popular albums that release sheet music to feature a PVG (piano voice guitar) format that present the music in stave, chordal and TAB form.</p>

<p>Most (not all) popular hits follow a simplistic underlying harmonic progression. The following video presents a great example of this and helps to reflect the simplicity of the genre in contrast to the complex rhythms associated with classical works and folk tunes. For those curious the song uses the chord pattern: I-V-vi-IV pattern in the key of E Major (E-B-C#m-A)</p>
