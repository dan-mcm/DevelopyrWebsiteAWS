<h1>What is Music Centre?</h1>
<p>This website aims to try and provide a well-rounded basis for the study of music. It examines the key aspects of music that should be studied i.e. the practical, aural and theoretical sides of the art form. It also aims to draw on my own and others personal experiences in music and how we have learned things along the way and how we can pool are resources together to come up with new more innovative methods towards teaching music.</p>
<p>My own background in music revolves around several years of keyboard lessons, a few small piano lessons and a lot of self-teaching in Piano, Guitar (acoustic and electric), Bass, Tin Whistle, Recorder and Ukulele. On the theoretical side of things I have a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Geography and Music, a Professional Diploma in Education from NUI Maynooth and I'm currently undertaking a High Diploma in Computer Science at UCD.</p>
<p>I hope this site will be of some use to those out there who want to take up an instrument and engage with the world of music. Music is everywhere and in the 21st century it's nearly impossible to think of landscapes separately to soundscapes.</p>
